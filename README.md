## Brief Overview
This repo contains some of my personally curated projects focused on Large Language Models(LLMs), particularly related to open-source models. These projects encompass frameworks for LLM training, deployment tools, tutorials, and practical applications.
The applications represent my original ideas, which I conceive, plan, develop, and test in real-world scenarios. They serve as a feedback loop, allowing me to gain experience in creating innovative ideas and testing various LLM models. Additionally, I utilise freely available platforms like Google Colab, Kaggle, and others to develop these projects.
