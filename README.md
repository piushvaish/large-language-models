## Brief Overview
This repo contains some of my personally curated projects focused on Large Language Models(LLMs), particularly related to open-source models. These projects encompass frameworks for LLM training, deployment tools, tutorials, and practical applications.

The applications represent my original ideas, which I conceive, plan, develop, and test in real-world scenarios. They serve as a feedback loop, allowing me to gain experience in creating innovative ideas and testing various LLM models. Additionally, I utilise freely available platforms like Google Colab, Kaggle, and others to develop these projects.

## Navigating the Repository

1. [Mini-projects](https://github.com/piushvaish/large-language-models/tree/main/mini-projects): Developed real-world applications of Generative AI. Text, speech, and images are generated using multi-modal models. These applications have been used in various real-life scenarios and are freely accessible to the public, allowing them to enjoy and share with friends and family.
* [Whodunit Lunch Party](https://github.com/piushvaish/large-language-models/blob/main/mini-projects/Whodunit-Challenges-Share-20240413T055534Z-001.zip)
Development of a murder mystery role-playing game that garnered a 4.7-star rating, employing LLMs for its creation. The game’s immersive plot, intriguing characters, and cleverly crafted clues were designed to enhance the gaming experience. The project uses a diverse tech stack that includes Python, ChatGPT, Dall-e, open-source models, and Gemini.

* [Immersive Audio Tour: National Gallery of Ireland](https://github.com/piushvaish/large-language-models/blob/main/mini-projects/ngi-highlight-tour-tts.ipynb)60-minute audio tour through the National Gallery of Ireland, delving into its various rooms and exhibits. Utilizing an open-source text-to-speech (TTS) model, the audio guide is crafted to emulate human speech, incorporating pauses and experimenting with different voices. This approach offers the advantage of personalization, allowing listeners to adjust the speed, translate into other languages.



* [ChatGPT-Driven Scavenger Hunt: Doors of South Dublin’s Georgian Architecture](https://github.com/piushvaish/large-language-models/blob/main/mini-projects/Doors%20of%20South%20Dublin%E2%80%99s%20Georgian%20Architecture.docx)
Developed a scavenger hunt game aimed at locating and photographing numerous famous doors of Dublin within a team setting. Utilised Google Maps, LLMs, and creative problem-solving techniques to execute the project effectively.

* [Treasure Hunt: Connect with People, Socialise, Be Creative and Have Fun](https://drive.google.com/file/d/17C91HPZo-7cF3vfHBpn6B5epbviqJoP0/view)
Created a treasure hunt game at St. Stephen’s Green Park to foster connections, encourage socialisation, stimulate creativity, and promote fun within a group. Leveraged Python, LLMs, and innovative problem-solving strategies.

2. [Tutorials](https://github.com/piushvaish/large-language-models/tree/main/open-source-models) Notebooks and short courses I completed to deepen my understanding of LLMs. These cover topics such as HuggingFace, Similarity Search, Sentence Transformers, and Generative AI models.
