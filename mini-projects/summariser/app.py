        Analyze the attached tender document and generate an ADHD-friendly summary that is clear, concise, and actionable. The summary should be structured as follows:

Quick Opportunity Snapshot:

Provide the project name, location, contracting authority, deadline, award date, and evaluation weighting.
Format as short, bold key details (e.g., 'Project: Roof Upgrade Works at Bray Institute of Further Education').
Main Sections (use clear, labeled headings):

Opportunity Overview:
Provide a one-liner summary of the project.
List key details such as contract type, authority name, and award timeline.
Whatâ€™s Needed?:
Provide a one-liner summary of submission requirements.
Use bullet points to list technical, financial, health & safety, and supporting document requirements.
How Youâ€™ll Be Scored:
Provide a one-liner summary of the evaluation criteria.
Break down the weighting (e.g., '70% Price, 30% Technical') and subcategories (e.g., Risk Plan 15%, Traffic Plan 7.5%).
Next Steps:
Provide a one-liner summary of action items.
Format as a simple checklist (e.g., '[ ] Register on eTenders').
Visual Enhancements:

Suggest visual elements such as icons, color-coded tags, and bar charts for evaluation weightings to improve engagement.
Sidebar Suggestions:

List useful quick links such as downloadable templates, FAQs, and contact details.
Keep the language simple and user-friendly, with a focus on making the tender accessible to someone who may find traditional formats overwhelming.
