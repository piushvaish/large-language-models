## Context
**What is an ATS?**

It’s computer software designed to scan resumes for certain keywords and weed out the ones that don’t match the job description.

So if you want your resume to actually make it into the hands of a human being, you need to make sure it’s optimized for the ATS.

How applicant tracking systems work? There are 4 basic steps to how an applicant tracking system works:

A job requisition enters into the ATS. This requisition includes information about the position, such as the job title, desired skills, and required experience.

The ATS then uses this information to create a profile for the ideal candidate.
As applicants submit their resumes, the ATS parses, sorts, and ranks them based on how well they match the profile.

Hiring managers then quickly identify the most qualified candidates and move them forward in the hiring process.
What’s especially important to understand is that recruiters often filter resumes by searching for key skills and job titles.

This means that if you can predict the resume keywords that recruiters will use in their search, you’ll greatly increase your chances of moving on in the hiring process. But you don’t have to guess which keywords to use. All you have to do is analyze the job description to find them.

**Who uses ATS?** 

Over 97% of Fortune 500 companies use ATS while a Kelly OCG survey estimated that 66% of large companies and 35% of small organizations rely on recruitment software. And these numbers continue to grow.

If you’re applying to a large organization, you’ll most likely face an ATS.

If you’re applying through any online form, you’re applying through an ATS.

Even job sites like Indeed and LinkedIn have their own built-in ATS.

It’s clear that ATS is here to stay. That’s why it’s so important to use the right keywords and format your resume in a way that makes it easy for ATS software to read.

**How to optimize your resume for an ATS?**
1. Carefully tailor your resume to the job description every single time you apply.
Optimize for ATS search and ranking algorithms by matching your resume keywords to the job description.
2. Use both the long-form and acronym version of keywords (e.g. “Master of Business Administration (MBA)” or “Search Engine Optimization (SEO)”) for maximum searchability.
3. Use a chronological or hybrid resume format (avoid the functional resume format).
4. Use a traditional resume font like Helvetica, Garamond, or Georgia.
5. Don’t use headers or footers as the information might get lost or cause a parsing error.
6. Use standard resume section headings like “Work Experience” rather than being cute or clever (“Where I’ve Been”).
