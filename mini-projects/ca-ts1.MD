To calculate TAM (Total Addressable Market), SAM (Serviceable Addressable Market), and SOM (Serviceable Obtainable Market), we need to break down the figures provided and make calculations for each step. Here's the breakdown:

Definitions:
TAM: Total market demand for the product or service.
SAM: The segment of TAM targeted by the business that matches the product/service.
SOM: The portion of SAM that the business can realistically capture.
1. TAM Calculation:
Formula:
TAM
=
Total Tourists
×
Holiday Purpose
×
Age Group Proportion
×
Gender Proportion
×
Activity Proportion
TAM=Total Tourists×Holiday Purpose×Age Group Proportion×Gender Proportion×Activity Proportion
2. SAM Calculation:
Provided directly for each country in the column labeled "SAM".
3. SOM Calculation:
Formula: 
SOM (Tourists)
=
SAM
×
Assumption Percentage of Market
SOM (Tourists)=SAM×Assumption Percentage of Market
SOM (Revenue in Euros)
=
SOM (Tourists)
×
Walking Tour Price
SOM (Revenue in Euros)=SOM (Tourists)×Walking Tour Price
