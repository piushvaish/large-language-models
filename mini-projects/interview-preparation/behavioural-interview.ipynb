You\nmust describe a specific event or situation, not a generalized description of what you have done in\nthe past. Be sure to give enough detail for the interviewer to understand. This situation can be\nfrom a previous job, from a volunteer experience, or any relevant event.\n* Task: What goal were you working toward?\n* Action: Describe the actions you took to address the situation with an appropriate amount of\ndetail and keep the focus on YOU. What specific steps did you take and what was your particular\ncontribution? Be careful that you don’t describe what the team or group did when talking about a\nproject, but what you actually did. Use the word “I,” not “we” when describing actions.\n* Result: Describe the outcome of your actions and don’t be shy about taking credit for your\nbehavior. What happened? How did the event end? What did you accomplish? What did you\nlearn? Make sure your answer contains multiple positive results.\n\nMake sure that you follow all parts of the STAR method.
