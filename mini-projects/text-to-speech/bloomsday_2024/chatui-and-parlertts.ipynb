The app uses MongoDB and SvelteKit behind the scenes. Tool calling allows users to define a schema, which the model then uses to generate output and invoke external tools. The process simplifies the selection of tools and their parameters.\n\nThis approach offers a seamless way to leverage the capabilities of large language models and integrate them with external tools to generate structured output, making it a powerful technique for various applications.\n\nThe conversation is available at:\n[Huggingface Chat](https://hf.co/chat/r/wWlL4Df)","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"!pip install git+https://github.com/huggingface/parler-tts.git\n","metadata":{"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"import torch\nfrom parler_tts import ParlerTTSForConditionalGeneration\nfrom transformers import AutoTokenizer\nimport soundfile as sf\n\ndevice = \"cuda:0\" if torch.cuda.is_available() else \"cpu\"\n\nmodel = ParlerTTSForConditionalGeneration.from_pretrained(\"parler-tts/parler_tts_mini_v0.1\").to(device)\ntokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(\"parler-tts/parler_tts_mini_v0.1\")","metadata":{"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"description = \"\"\"\nA female speaker with a low-pitched voice delivers \nher words quite expressively, \nin a very confined sounding environment with clear audio quality. \nShe speaks at a normal speed.\nEnsure people understand her clearly.\nThe tone is confident, enthusiastic, personal, informative, casual and friendly.\nReverberation times is between 1.0-1.5 s,\nNormal speaking pitch is between 165 hertz and 255 hertz.\n\"\"\"\n\nprompt = \"\"\"\n\nJames Joyce's Ulysses, is a challenging and innovative novel.\n\nIt takes place over the course of a single day in Dublin, Ireland. \nThe book follows three main characters: Stephen Dedalus, Leopold Bloom, and Molly Bloom.\n\nIt offers an in-depth exploration of their inner lives through \na stream-of-consciousness narrative style. \n\n\"\"\"","metadata":{"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"input_ids = tokenizer(description, return_tensors=\"pt\").input_ids.to(device)\nprompt_input_ids = tokenizer(prompt, return_tensors=\"pt\").input_ids.to(device)\n\ngeneration = model.generate(input_ids=input_ids, prompt_input_ids=prompt_input_ids)\naudio_arr = generation.cpu().numpy().squeeze()","metadata":{"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"from IPython.display import Audio\nAudio(audio_arr, rate=model.config.sampling_rate, autoplay=True)","metadata":{"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"https://huggingface.co/spaces/parler-tts/parler_tts_mini\n\n* What is a normal speaking pitch?\nTypical male voices range in pitch from 85 hertz to 180 hertz; typical female voices, from 165 hertz to 255 hertz.
