# Bloomsday Audio Tour
Welcome to the Bloomsday Audio Tour project! 
This project focuses on creating an audio-guided tour of one of the most challenging books to read, offering a unique and practical use case for Generative AI in the travel and tourism industry. The experience is designed to engage readers and travelers alike, bringing a classic and beloved book to life.

Through the use of multiple LLMs and innovative techniques, the project summarizes chapters, generates period-accurate music from the early 1900s, and presents content in multiple languages. By leveraging open-source models and free computing resources, the audio guide provides an immersive and enjoyable experience for explorers to discover and engage with the book's world.

The project showcases the potential of AI to enhance and complement our understanding and enjoyment of classic literature, opening up new avenues for exploration and appreciation.
